A toy Java Virtual Machine coded in C. CVM is a simple and lightweight JVM that aims to provide a basic understanding of JVM internals and bytecode execution. This project serves as an educational and fun resource for those interested in learning about JVM implementation details.

## Features

- Implementation of a minimalistic JVM in C
- Support for executing Java bytecode
- Basic class loading and method execution
- Instruction set interpretation

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with CVM:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cvm.git
   cd cvm
   ```
2. **Compile the Source Code:**
   
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd ./build
   cmake ../
   make all
   ```
3. **Run a Java Program:**
   
   ```bash
   ./cvm JavaProgram.class
   ```

## Usage

CVM accepts a Java class file as a command-line argument. It loads and executes the main method of the specified class.

Example:
```bash
./cvm HelloWorld.class
```
